# stlToSolid

## Why

I do a lot of hobby 3D-printing projects, designing parts for my own use.
Again and again I needed to model *around* a mesh part — a bracket from
Thingiverse, a scanned housing, a controller shell — and Fusion 360 gave me
no easy way to do it: on the free hobby tier, **Mesh → Solid** turns the
mesh into a solid made of hundreds or thousands of facet triangles, which is
impossible to measure, sketch on, or model against. So I built this: it
turns a mesh into a solid with real planes, cylinders and holes that I can
actually design against once it is imported into Fusion 360 (see the
[comparison](#compared-with-fusion-360s-mesh-to-solid) below).

## What it does

Convert STL / OBJ (also PLY, OFF, 3MF, GLB) meshes into **prismatic STEP
solids** — clean BREP with true planes, cylinders and cones you can sketch
on, dimension against, and constrain — replicating the core of Fusion 360's
paid "Prismatic" mesh conversion, plus something Fusion does not give you: an
**editable CadQuery script** of the sketches and extrudes it recognised.
Guaranteed output: when a mesh isn't an extrusion, the **face-group engine**
groups it into surface regions and gives each a real plane, cylinder, cone,
sphere or torus face (Fusion's face-group approach, in the open; a
rolling-ball fillet around a boss or a hole mouth is one torus face); regions nothing fits
keep their exact facets; when even that fails, the tool falls back to a
faceted (valid, manifold, coplanar-merged, tolerance-reduced) STEP solid
instead of failing.

### Sliced loft (v0.4)

For shapes that change smoothly along one axis — lens caps, handles,
shells, bottles — and for flat plates with a fancy outline (sliced across
their thin side), `--method loft` does what you would do by hand in Fusion
with **Create Mesh Section Sketch → Fit Curves to Mesh Section → Loft**,
automatically: the body is sliced along one axis every 0.2 mm (default),
every section outline is redrawn as a closed B-spline, and the stack is
lofted into **one smooth face per run of sections**. Runs break at flat
faces across the axis (a shoulder stays a real planar face, not a smear)
and where the outline count changes; holes along the axis are lofted and
cut; a dome tip gets a short cone to the apex. The result is written
whenever it can be built — you chose the method — and the acceptance gate
is reported for information. Alongside the STEP comes `<out>_fusion.py`,
which repeats the workflow as a Fusion timeline: one sketch per section
(closed fitted splines on offset planes) and one Loft per run, holes as
Loft cuts.

Not for machined parts with slots, sideways holes and steps: a hole
drilled *across* the slicing axis becomes a trough, because no slice sees
it as a circle, and sharp corners *around* an outline are followed within
the spline tolerance (0.02 mm) but are not sharp edges. Mesh → Solid
does those parts with true planes and cylinders (the servo bracket sample:
2 s, one solid, 0.06 mm); the report says so when a part looks prismatic.

What the loft does on its own (v0.4.6): `auto` picks the axis by slicing
structure, not the longest side — a round cap is longest across its face
but wants its short axis (the body-cap sample: 10 minutes and 707 loose
solids along X, 22 s and one solid along Z), a 4 mm plate wants its thin
axis; the report says which axis and why. Outlines the shared spline
basis cannot fit (cornered sections) are lofted ruled straight away, and
identical sections collapse to one straight stretch, so a prism is one
face per side. A run whose rings do not correspond is lofted pair by pair
instead of being dropped, a pair that still fails is extruded straight,
and the report lists every run, hole or pair it had to give up on, and
whether the pieces fused to one solid.

`stl_to_solid/section_fit.py` holds the shared plane cutter and the curve
fitter (lines and arcs where they hold the tolerance, fitted splines where
they do not) — numpy only, so the same file can run inside Fusion.
`tools/trace_section.py` draws one section the way the fitter sees it.

**Single slice from the web app.** With Sliced Loft or X-Ray chosen in
the top toolbar, the 3D view shows a labelled XYZ triad (X red, Y green,
Z blue, as in Fusion) and a translucent plane across the chosen axis; a
slider moves the plane by an offset from the part's centre and the traced
outline is drawn on it (`GET /api/jobs/{id}/section`; `/section-script`
gives that one sketch as a Fusion script). In X-Ray, start = end is the
single slice and its download.
A leaky mesh (loose surface patches, a scan) cuts into open chains as well
as closed loops; they are drawn open, exactly as Fusion's mesh section
draws them, after loose ends closer than "Join gaps up to" (default
2.5 mm, `join=`) have been joined, so an outline broken only by hairline
cracks between patches comes back as one closed profile. 0 joins
nothing. "Outline only" (`outline=true`) draws just the outer outline,
leaving the open pieces and every inner loop out, for one clean profile
to extrude; "Trim slivers up to"
(`trim=`) cuts hairpins and thin twists narrower than that out of the
loops, where the mesh has a double skin. A loop that is thin all over (a
1.3 mm wall beside a cross hole with the trim at 1.5) is a feature and is
left whole (0.4.7; it used to come back as a stub), and the panel warns
when the mesh is watertight, since such a mesh has no double skin to
trim. The X-Ray keeps its own gap and trim values, so a trim set for a
leaky loft does not carry into the next part's X-Ray.

**X-Ray (v0.4.5).** The X-Ray tool draws a whole stack of those sketches
between two planes: pick the axis, a start plane, an end plane and a
spacing, and the slices are traced one after another, each one staying in
the 3D view as it appears, so the stack shows up slice by slice like an
x-ray between the two planes (start solid, end dashed, marked S and E).
"Download Fusion sketches" builds one script with a fully enclosed sketch
per slice on its own construction plane, named `xray Z=12.34 mm (k/N)`
(`GET /api/jobs/{id}/xray-script?axis&from&to&step&tol&units&scale&join&
outline&trim&extrude`, and `/xray` for the count and plane positions). The
planes sit at start + k·spacing and the end plane is always the last one;
both ends are kept 0.001 mm inside the part so no plane lands exactly on
a flat end face. The script embeds the slice data once and draws it in a
loop with each sketch's compute deferred, behind a progress dialog with
Cancel — the same approach as the private Fusion add-in — so a
hundred-sketch stack opens in seconds. "Extrude each slice to the next"
(`extrude=true`) also extrudes every sketch up to the next plane and joins
it to the slabs before it (a new body where nothing touches, which the
next slab then joins: Fusion does not fail a Join that meets nothing, it
quietly makes a new body, and until 0.4.7 that body was never joined
again, so one arm of a bracket came out as a stack of loose slabs),
giving a stepped solid that Fusion builds without fail where a Loft
between two complex profiles folds over. Only the material profiles are
extruded: each section carries its loops' areas (outer minus holes) and
the script skips the hole interiors Fusion also lists as profiles, so a
hole along the axis stays open when its loop is drawn (Outline only
leaves hole loops out and so fills them). The last slab is one spacing
long but stops at the part's far face, and an end plane closer than half
a spacing to the slice before it is drawn only, that slice's slab running
through, so no hair-thin slab is made. One download fits at most 500 slices and
spends at most 240 s fitting (`STLTOSOLID_XRAY_BUDGET`); the panel
estimates the build time from the traces so far and suggests Outline
only, which is about five times faster on organic sections (the fit is
the cost, not the cut: 8 ms a slice on a clean CAD bracket, 6 s on a
158k-triangle controller scan).

The sliced loft's cutter uses the same join and trim settings
(`--slice-join`, `--slice-trim`), so a leaky shell lofts from the same
outlines the slice view shows. "Loft only N mm from this plane" (`--slice-from`,
`--slice-range`, `--slice-dir`) lofts just a stretch of the body, starting
at the slider's plane, with flat ends; the check then measures only that
stretch of the mesh.

### Blueprint (v0.5)

The fourth tool starts from a picture, not a mesh: drop or paste a
dimensioned drawing (front / top / side views with their labels, like a
servo's datasheet drawing) and get back a parametric Fusion 360 script,
a STEP and a 3D preview. A vision model of your choice reads the labels
into a small **recipe**: named parameters in mm (`body_w = 22.5`,
`hole_d = 2.0`) and a short list of features, each one sketch plane (XY =
top view, XZ = front, YZ = right side, at an offset along its normal),
one or more shapes on it (rectangle, circle, slot, polygon) and one
extrude (new body / join / cut, a distance or through-all). Numbers may be
expressions over the parameters (`body_w/2`). Every number is shown in a
table with where it came from; values the model had to deduce are marked.
Fix a misread one and the view redraws within a second (a warm helper
process keeps the geometry kernel loaded; the shape only, no files); press
**Rebuild** for the STEP and the script, again without asking the model.
The 3D view is coloured by feature, the same colours as the swatches in
the feature list, and hovering a feature lights it up in the view, so
which number moves what is plain to see.

Before anything is built the recipe goes through deterministic checks:
every expression resolves, shapes have size, the first feature is a body,
a cut removes something, a join touches something, no shape is nested
inside another in one sketch, and the built bounding box matches the
drawing's overall size (an error beyond ±3 %, a warning beyond ±1.5 %,
with a hint when two axes are off because a view was mapped to the wrong
plane). A recipe that fails a check is sent back to the model once with
the list; what still fails is shown in the table for you to fix.

The same recipe is built twice from one source: CadQuery makes the STEP
and the preview the web viewer shows, and the Fusion script
(`output_fusion.py`, run from Scripts and Add-Ins in a new parametric
design) makes **User Parameters** for every recipe parameter, one sketch
per feature with driving dimensions bound to those parameters
(`body_w / 2`), and an Extrude per feature. Change `body_h` in Modify →
Change Parameters and the boss on top moves with it. The X-Ray script's
plumbing is reused: data literals plus a fixed runtime, a progress
dialog, profiles picked by their expected area so holes stay open.

**Providers and keys.** The panel offers Anthropic (Claude, the default),
OpenAI, DeepSeek and a *Custom* OpenAI-compatible URL (Ollama with a
vision model keeps the drawing on your own machine; OpenRouter works
too). Model names are editable. Your key is kept in the browser's local
storage and sent with each read as a header; the server uses it for
that one call and never writes it to disk or a log. With no key in the
browser the server's own `STLTOSOLID_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` is used when
set — an opt-in for a private install, since anyone who can reach the
app could spend it. DeepSeek: use `deepseek-flash` (the default), which
reads images; `deepseek-v4-pro` takes no images. Both get thinking
switched on explicitly and JSON mode (`json_object`, the schema in the
prompt, since DeepSeek has no `json_schema`); Effort low / medium / high
maps to DeepSeek's low / high / max, and the image goes at detail
`original` (full resolution). The drawing is sent to the provider
you pick and nowhere else.

Routes: `POST /api/blueprints` (the image; .jpg, .png or .webp, up to
`STLTOSOLID_MAX_IMAGE`), `GET /api/blueprints/config` (providers and
whether the server holds a key for each), `POST
/api/blueprints/{id}/read` (`{provider, model?, base_url?, hints?}` with
the key in `X-Api-Key`; the job goes `reading` → `queued` → `running` →
`done`), `POST /api/blueprints/{id}/build` (`{recipe}`, no model call; a
400 lists what the checks refused), `GET /api/blueprints/{id}/recipe`
and `/drawing`; then the usual `/api/jobs/{id}`, `/download`,
`/fusion-script` and `/preview`; `POST /api/blueprints/{id}/preview`
(`{recipe}`) is the live look (the mesh at `/live.stl`, one feature index
per triangle in the answer) and `GET /api/blueprints/{id}/preview-map`
the same colouring for the full build. Install the reader's dependencies with
`pip install -e '.[blueprint]'` (the Docker image has them).

## Screenshots

The web app: drop a mesh, inspect it, pick a tool, set the acceptance gate,
convert, and read the fidelity report before downloading the STEP (and, for
extrusions, the CadQuery / Fusion 360 scripts). (Screenshots predate the
v0.4.5 toolbar.)

The same `servo_bracket_1.stl`, opened in Fusion 360 three ways. Left:
Fusion's own *Mesh → Solid* (the free tier's faceted conversion — every
triangle becomes a face). Middle: the STL mesh as loaded. Right: the STEP
from stl_to_solid — 23 faces, planes and cylinders, holes that are real holes.

## Install

```bash
pip install .            # core
pip install .[scan]      # + pymeshlab, for 3D-scan repair (Poisson; Linux x86_64)
```

## Usage

```bash
stltosolid part.stl                 # -> part.step  (+ part.py CadQuery script)
stltosolid part.obj --units cm      # file is in cm (Fusion's OBJ default); scale to mm
stltosolid part.stl out.step --tol 0.05 --accept-max 0.3 --accept-vol-pct 3
stltosolid scan.stl --reduce-tol 0.1     # faceted output: simplify curved regions within 0.1 mm
stltosolid scan.stl --force-prismatic    # attempt prismatic on scan input
stltosolid part.stl --no-face-groups     # skip the face-group engine (prismatic -> faceted only)
stltosolid shell.stl --method loft       # sliced loft: sections every 0.2 mm along the longest axis, smooth loft
stltosolid shell.stl --method loft --slice-mm 0.5 --slice-axis z --loft-ruled
stltosolid big.stl --scale 0.1           # a cm design exported as mm: shrink by ten
```

Or from Python:

```python
from stl_to_solid import run
result = run("part.stl", "part.step")
print(result["mode"], result["metrics"], result["script"])   # 'prismatic' | 'facegroup' | 'faceted' | 'loft' | 'mixed'
result = run("shell.stl", "shell.step", method="loft", slice_mm=0.2, slice_axis="auto")
print(result["metrics"]["loft"], result["fusion_script"])     # sections, runs, holes; the Fusion loft script
```

Exit code 0 on success. The log reports which route produced the output
(`prismatic`, `facegroup` or `faceted`) and the measured fidelity (surface
deviation both ways, bore deviation, volume error) of prismatic and
face-group results.

Outputs next to the STEP: for prismatic results `<out>.py` (CadQuery) and
`<out>_fusion.py` (Fusion 360 sketches + extrudes — verified: a fully
parametric timeline you can edit); for sliced-loft results
`<out>_fusion.py` (section sketches + Loft features, not yet run inside
Fusion); for face-group results
`<out>_fusion_bfill.py` — an **experimental Fusion 360 Boundary Fill
script**. It recreates every fitted plane, cylinder, cone, sphere and torus
slightly oversized as a temporary body, runs Boundary Fill, and keeps the
cells that lie inside the original mesh (the mesh travels inside the
script). Fusion's own kernel then computes the exact edges between the
faces, so the solid comes out without the polyline edges of the STEP.

To run either script in Fusion: put the `.py` in an empty folder of its
own, then Utilities → Add-Ins → Scripts and Add-Ins → **+** → choose that
folder → Run. Progress appears in the Text Commands panel (View → Show
Text Commands).

Boundary Fill status: verified on parts the engine fits cleanly (planes,
cylinders, cones, spheres, fillets, holes — exact face counts). Torus blends
(fillets around curved edges) are one torus tool each; an apex cone (a
pencil tip) is one solid cone tool; a tapered / variable-radius fillet kept
as bands in the STEP becomes a single approximate torus or cone tool per
chain (tangent band chains defeat the cell computation). The printed
outlook is an OCC dry run of the actual script — the tools are rebuilt,
the cells computed and the enclosed volume measured — so OK / LIKELY TO
FAIL reflects the arrangement itself, not a guess. Still fails on bodies
whose gently curved plates segment into near-parallel plane strips (the
frame — see Roadmap). Bodies with more than 200 regions get no script;
`EXPAND` at the top of the script sets the oversize (1 mm by default).

## Web app

A browser UI for the same pipeline: drag a mesh in, inspect it in 3D, pick
a tool in the top toolbar, set the tolerances, and download the result.
The toolbar (v0.4.5) starts with **New project** (load another file) and
then one button per tool (four since v0.5, Blueprint being the one that
takes a picture); the panel on the right shows that tool's name
as a cyan heading and only its controls, over the shared setup (which
bodies to use, input units and scale, the mesh's stats).

- **Mesh → Solid.** The auto ladder: prismatic fit, then face groups,
  then faceted, held to the acceptance gate you set. Convert, read the
  fidelity report (route, surface deviation vs. your limits, volume error,
  face counts and surface types, regions kept as facets), download the
  STEP and, for prismatic results, the CadQuery and Fusion 360 scripts.
- **Sliced Loft.** Slice spacing and axis, a single-slice plane you can
  drag through the part with its traced outline, gap joining, sliver
  trimming, outline-only, a partial loft from that plane, ruled or smooth.
  Convert gives the lofted STEP and the Fusion loft script.
- **Blueprint.** Drop or paste a dimensioned drawing (the stage shows it,
  with a *Drawing | 3D* switch once the part is built); pick the vision
  model and paste your key (kept in this browser); optional notes for the
  reader; **Read drawing** shows *Reading the drawing…* then *Building…*
  (Cancel works in both); the parameters table and the feature list with
  every number editable, inferred and low-confidence ones marked;
  **Rebuild** after an edit; the size against the drawing's, the volume,
  who read it and what it cost in tokens; downloads of the parametric
  Fusion script and the STEP. Edits redraw the coloured shape live; the
  feature list's swatches match the view and hovering a row lights it up.
- **X-Ray.** Axis, start plane, end plane, spacing (or *Whole part*); the
  slice count and a time estimate; the slices traced one by one and left
  in the 3D view (a *stop* link halts the trace, *trace the rest* resumes
  it); the same fit options as the single slice plus the fit tolerance;
  *Extrude each slice to the next* for solid slabs; and **Download Fusion
  sketches**, which shows *Working…* with a spinner while the server fits
  every slice and hands you the .py when it is ready. To run it: put the
  file in an empty folder, then in Fusion Utilities → Add-Ins → Scripts and
  Add-Ins → + → choose that folder → Run.

The ViewCube sits top-right as in Fusion; every button visibly presses;
loading a file, converting and building a script all show a spinner with
what is being waited for.

### Run locally (dev)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e . fastapi 'uvicorn[standard]' python-multipart
.venv/bin/uvicorn backend.main:app --port 8000     # API
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev           # UI on :5173, proxies /api
```

### Run as a container

```bash
docker compose up --build        # then open http://localhost:8321
./deploy.sh                      # same, but stamps the image with the git commit,
                                 # shown top-right in the UI and at /api/version
```

To run it on a home NAS (any x86_64 box with Docker: clone on the NAS, build
natively, optional Tailscale HTTPS front), follow
[docs/DEPLOY-NAS.md](docs/DEPLOY-NAS.md).

Environment knobs: `STLTOSOLID_DATA` (job storage dir, default `/data` in
the container), `STLTOSOLID_JOB_TTL` (seconds before old jobs are purged,
default 86400), `STLTOSOLID_MAX_UPLOAD` (bytes, default 200 MB),
`STLTOSOLID_WORKERS` (shells converted at once in worker processes, default
half the cores; 0 converts in-process, as does any file under 20k faces
when the count is not set explicitly), `STLTOSOLID_SHELL_TIMEOUT` (seconds
a shell may run in a worker before it is built faceted instead, default
900; 0 means no limit), `STLTOSOLID_AXIS_BUDGET` (seconds one shell's extrusion-axis search may
take before the best candidate so far is used, default 120; 0 means no
limit), `STLTOSOLID_XRAY_BUDGET` (seconds one X-Ray script download may
spend fitting its slices before it answers 400, default 240 — under a
browser's 300 s response limit), `STLTOSOLID_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
`STLTOSOLID_OPENAI_API_KEY` / `STLTOSOLID_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (Blueprint's
opt-in server-side keys), `STLTOSOLID_BLUEPRINT_TIMEOUT` (seconds one
read of a drawing may take, default 300, and 1200 for DeepSeek, whose max
effort thinks for several minutes; when set it applies to every provider), `STLTOSOLID_MAX_IMAGE` (bytes,
default 20 MB), `STLTOSOLID_PREVIEW_TIMEOUT` (seconds one live preview
may take in the helper before it is killed and restarted, default 45).
The budgets are backstops: a shell that reaches one is scored on
what was done by then, so its result can depend on machine load. The CLI
takes the first two as `--workers` and `--shell-timeout`. The same workers
score a big single shell's axis candidates side by side and run the
Boundary Fill dry run two bodies at a time; the log ends with a `[time]`
line giving the wall clock per stage (conversion, STEP write, scripts and
dry run).

## How it works

The pipeline implements the classical reverse-engineering architecture
(segmentation -> primitive fitting -> constraint solving -> rebuild), using
the *extrusion-cylinder* decomposition strategy rather than free surface
stitching — which sidesteps the brittle face-intersection/topology problem
that makes general mesh-to-BREP hard — extended with lofts, cross-axis
features and local patching so that one axis need not explain everything.

1. **Prep** (`mesh_prep`) — load, weld, repair. Vertices closer than 1e-6 of
   the bounding box are welded (exporters leave micron cracks that split a
   part), duplicate/degenerate faces dropped, OBJ per-corner normals/UVs
   merged away. Units (`--units mm|cm|in|ft|m`) scale the mesh on load; the UI
   suggests a unit from the bounding box. Connected shells are split into
   bodies; a shell *inside* another is an internal cavity and is attached to
   its body as a void, so a hollow part becomes one hollow solid (the
   cavity goes in as an inner shell of the solid, not a boolean). Scan-like
   input (dense, low dihedral, no exactly-coplanar facets) is rebuilt via the
   pymeshlab repair ladder and decimated with topology preservation.
2. **Axis discovery** (`extrusion`) — face normals are clustered on the
   Gaussian sphere; each candidate axis is offered raw *and* snapped to
   global XYZ (when within 5°) and *scored* by the volume fraction of the
   part that has a constant (or linearly varying) cross-section along it,
   with the perpendicular-face area as a tie-breaker. Snapping is a
   hypothesis, not a decision: a part tilted 3° keeps its true axis.
3. **Slab decomposition** — planar faces perpendicular to the axis vote for
   height levels; each slab is cross-sectioned at several heights *and* just
   inside its ends. Where the section starts or stops changing (a chamfer,
   countersink or boss top) or its topology changes, a level is inserted by
   bisection and snapped to a mesh-vertex height. Constancy compares section
   *shapes* (IoU + boundary distance), not just areas.
4. **Profile fitting** (`profile_fit`) — each polygon ring is segmented into
   **lines and circular arcs**: recursive split (at real corners first),
   Taubin circle fits with deviation measured against the whole polyline
   (chord interiors included, so a big circle through the ends of a straight
   wall cannot pass), a cyclic merge pass, boundary refinement between
   neighbours, arc radii/centres re-fitted on the mesh vertices (which lie
   exactly on the CAD surface — section vertices sit on chords), and
   junction solving: line/line at their intersection, tangent line/arc
   fillets solved exactly, lines squared to the dominant frame.
5. **Constraint snapping** (GlobFit-lite, `rebuild._global_snap`) — radii and
   centres are clustered *globally across all slabs* and snapped to cluster
   means. This turns facet-noise families like r = 5.242..5.257 into a
   single design radius.
6. **Rebuild** (`rebuild`) — constant slabs are extruded; slabs whose section
   varies linearly (drafts, chamfers, countersinks, tapered ribs) are
   **lofted with analytic faces** — planes between matched lines, cones /
   cylinders between matched arcs and circles. Equal consecutive slabs are
   merged, Booleans use a fuzzy tolerance, and a finishing pass drops
   micro-edges, unifies same-domain faces and checks validity.
7. **Cross-axis features** (`features`) — curved facet regions are split
   into coaxial primitives and classified: **cylinders** (bores not parallel
   to the main axis, radius/axis refined by least squares on the vertices,
   blind ends kept blind) and **cones** (countersinks, chamfered hole
   mouths) are subtracted as analytic features.
8. **Validate + gate** (`pipeline`) — deterministic, *symmetric* deviation
   (mesh → solid on area-uniform samples plus every vertex; solid → mesh),
   bore deviation, volume error. Passing → prismatic. Failing → the next
   rungs, each held to the same gate:
   * **Face-group engine** (`facegroups`) — the mesh's coplanar components
     are seeds for a greedy, fit-driven region growing (never across a
     dihedral > 25°): a region grows while a plane / cylinder / cone / sphere
     (simplest first) explains its **vertices** within a few microns and its
     facet interiors within the fit tolerance — the second test is what stops
     a wide plane and its first fillet strip from being fitted by an exact,
     absurdly large cylinder. A rolling-ball blend around a curved edge (a
     boss-base fillet, a filleted hole mouth) comes out of growth as a chain
     of short cylinder bands whose axes are all tangents of one circle; the
     engine then fits a **torus** to each such chain (seeded from the bands'
     own axes) and absorbs every neighbour it explains. Directions, coaxial
     axes, coplanar offsets and equal radii are then snapped within
     measurement uncertainty (reverted
     if a snap moves a surface off its vertices), and every region becomes
     one trimmed face on its fitted surface: boundary polylines projected
     onto the surface (a shared vertex table keeps both sides of every edge
     identical for sewing), `MakeFace` + `ShapeFix_Face`, seams placed
     through boundary vertices. Regions no primitive fits, or whose face
     will not build, keep their exact facets. Sew → largest solid → heal →
     check → gate. Mode `facegroup`; no sketch/extrude script for it.
   * **Hybrid patch** (`hybrid`): the prismatic solid with its deviating
     regions boxed and replaced by the exact faceted geometry,
     `(P − B) ∪ (F ∩ B)`, re-checked. Keeps the script.
   * **Faceted** route: coplanar triangles merged into single planar faces
     *before* sewing, curved regions decimated within `--reduce-tol`, sewn

### Research basis

The architecture follows the standard two-phase scan-to-BREP paradigm
(segmentation + fitting) established by Schnabel et al.'s Efficient RANSAC
(2007) and surveyed in recent literature; the extrusion-cylinder
decomposition is the classical analogue of Point2Cyl (CVPR 2022) / PrismCAD;
global constraint snapping follows GlobFit (Li et al.); validation-gated
output with honest fallback and local patching is our own addition.

## Measured results (v0.3)

Default gates (fit tol 0.08 mm, p95 ≤ 0.25, max ≤ 0.26, bore ≤ 0.10 mm,
volume ≤ 2 %). "faces" = ADVANCED_FACE count in the STEP.

| part | triangles | mode | faces | max dev | vol err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| servo_bracket_1 | 1,644 | prismatic | 23 (was 60) | 0.060 mm | 0.08 % |
| servo_bracket_2 | 1,712 | prismatic | 19 (was 28) | 0.044 mm | 0.06 % |
| top_arm_1 | 3,896 | prismatic (chamfered bosses as cones) | 44 (was 1,245 faceted) | 0.050 mm | 0.00 % |
| top_arm_2 | 3,816 | prismatic | 40 (was 1,213 faceted) | 0.050 mm | 0.05 % |
| joystick_claw_1 | 2,134 | face-group (27 cyl, 5 spheres, 8 cones, 5 tori) | 153 (was 495 in v0.3.3, 671 patched) | 0.019 mm | 0.07 % |
| joystick_claw_2 | 1,902 | face-group (17 cyl, 12 spheres, 13 cones, 5 tori) | 208 (was 226 in v0.3.2, 341 faceted) | 0.047 mm | 0.04 % |
| frame | 4,200 | face-group (9 cyl, 7 cones) | 101 (was 160 in v0.3.2, 516 faceted) | 0.040 mm | 0.03 % |
| Mesh_90p (scan) | 2.17 M | faceted (scan route) | 39,575 | — | 0.00 % |

The remaining planar faces on the face-group parts are blends (tapered
corner fillets, free-form) that v1 keeps as exact facets.

v0.3.9 (pick the bodies to convert): a file's connected bodies are listed
on upload and drawn in the viewer, each in its own colour, and clicking
one selects it. Only the ticked bodies are converted. A 68-body
controller where two housing halves were wanted took 18 minutes to
convert all 71 solids; the two take about 10. The default ticks every
body down to 5% of the largest, which is the housing halves and none of
the 70 screws. The selection travels as a shell identity (face count,
proportions, position and size as fractions of the file), not an index:
preparation folds cavities into their parent body, so the list the UI
shows and the list the pipeline converts diverge, and an index would
silently select the wrong part. A mesh whose size is implausible for a
part is flagged before conversion rather than after — that controller
reads 1499 mm across, ten times too big, which no input unit corrects.

v0.3.8 (cavities as inner shells): a body's cavities are added to its
solid as inner shells, the way OCC and STEP represent a hollow solid,
instead of being subtracted with a fuzzy boolean. The cut had the kernel
compare every outer face with every cavity face: on the 68-body
controller's hollow body (a 15.8k-face outer, two cavities of 20k and 6k
faces) that took 77 minutes and returned an empty solid. The inner shell
takes milliseconds, keeps every fitted face as it was, and the volume is
outer minus cavities exactly. A cavity that touches or pokes through the
wall after fitting, or sits inside another, still takes the boolean
(`void_method` in the metrics says which route a body took, and why).
The nesting that finds cavities now checks every vertex of an inner
shell, not one: a shell that crosses its container's surface (that
controller's two "cavities" reached 29 mm and 3.7 mm outside the body)
is an overlapping part, not a cavity, and is kept as a solid of its own
with a `[bodies]` line saying so.

v0.3.7 (shells in parallel): a file's shells (each body's outer surface
and each cavity) are converted side by side in spawned worker processes,
largest first, and each body reassembled afterwards exactly as before: the
same STEP, per-solid faces and volumes, with one worker or four. A shell
past its wall clock (`STLTOSOLID_SHELL_TIMEOUT`, 900 s) or whose worker
died under it (an OCC crash costs that shell, not the job) is built
faceted in the pool on a shorter clock and says so in its metrics
(`timed_out`, `shell_error`). The pool is one per run: its workers start
on first use and serve the shells, a big single shell's axis candidates
(scored side by side from 20k faces) and the Boundary Fill dry run (two
bodies at a time, each and all under the 120 s budget). Small files stay
in-process, where a worker's start-up would outlast the conversion. The
log carries one block per shell as it finishes, `[progress] k/n shells`,
and a closing `[time]` line per stage. On the 68-body controller (72
shells) four workers convert every shell in about 18 minutes; the file
previously never finished. Knobs: `STLTOSOLID_WORKERS`,
`STLTOSOLID_SHELL_TIMEOUT`, `--workers`, `--shell-timeout`; the NAS runs
two workers.

v0.3.6 (the extrusion search made finite): a 12k-face textured cavity in
a 68-body controller offered 772 perpendicular levels on one axis and kept
the level refinement busy for 41 minutes; the same shell's axis search now
takes about 27 s. A candidate with more than 120 levels is not an
extrusion and scores 0 unsectioned; every slab's probe heights are cut in
one pass and slabs are cached by height, so a refinement round sections
only the two slabs a new level made; a slab's bisections are done once,
not once per round; bisection probes chain their own loops (trimesh's path
machinery was the cost on sections of hundreds of tiny loops) over just the
faces that span the slab; the same-section test runs its cheap parts
first; candidate scoring stops once no remaining candidate can win; and a
budget (`STLTOSOLID_AXIS_BUDGET`, 120 s per shell) backstops the whole
search — past it the best candidate so far is used, or the shell goes to
the face-group route. The sample STEPs are unchanged.

v0.3.5 (the dry run made honest and fast): the OCC dry run behind the
Boundary Fill outlook now builds exactly the tools the script builds — the
script's own arc growth is executed from its text (the emulation had grown
arcs by at most 30° where Fusion grows by up to 180° and closes near-full
arcs into circles), a cone tool's two ends share one angular window, the
SKIP list is honoured, unbuildable tools are skipped and counted, and cells
are classified by the same procedure as the runtime (probe point, interior
point, face probe for slivers, closest-volume fallback). It is ~50× faster
(one classifier per cell behind a bounding-box test: claw_1's conversion
270 s → 36 s) and judges every body on its own — a region none of whose
probe points lies in a cell, or a body the script had to leave out, is a
FAIL; a kernel error or a body past the time budget is "not checked"
rather than a guess; the script's own header carries the same verdict as
the UI. Also: merged tapered-fillet cones are snapped to their tangent
planes; pieces of one torus/sphere/cone fit (pinch repair) become one tool
instead of two coincident ones; blend chains are walked in chain order; the
segmenter's acceptance test and seeders are shared with the blend merge;
region ids in the script's log carry the engine ids they were made from
(`12<3,4,5>`). claw_1's dry run: 101.2 % enclosed, OK.

v0.3.4 (pinched boundaries, blend tools, real Boundary Fill outlook): a
region whose boundary pinches (an annulus whose hole touches the rim at one
vertex) is repaired by peeling the faces at the pinch instead of falling to
triangles — joystick_claw_1's biggest plane was one such region, 290
triangles for what is now 3 planar faces (claw_1: 495 → 153). Regions that
still get no analytic face are emitted as one planar face per coplanar
facet group instead of raw triangles. For the Boundary Fill script only,
chains of tangent blend bands (tapered / variable-radius fillets) are
merged into single approximate torus or cone tools — a G1 chain of tangent
bands defeats the kernel's cell computation, and a cutting tool only has to
stay within the fit tolerance; the STEP keeps the exact bands. The Boundary
Fill outlook is now an OCC dry run of the actual script (build the tools,
compute the cells, measure the enclosed volume) instead of a heuristic:
claw_1 gets its first OK (cells enclose 100.3 % of the mesh).

v0.3.3 (apex and tapered cones): a pointed cone is one conical face closed
at the tip by a degenerate edge (a pencil part: 1 plane + 1 cylinder +
1 cone), and a tapered pin is a few cones instead of dozens of short
cylinder bands — the cone seeding now centres the axis with a per-slab
circle fit (a sector of a real cone used to be rejected before the
least-squares fit ever ran), and a post-growth cone-chain merge joins
near-coaxial bands, cone sectors and ring-like "sphere" bands (any two
vertex rings lie exactly on some sphere) into single cones. The frame
dropped 160 → 101 faces, the claws to 495 / 208. The Boundary Fill script
emits an apex-reaching cone as one solid cone tool.

v0.3.2 (torus fits): a rolling-ball blend around a curved edge is one torus
face instead of a chain of short cylinder bands (boss-base fillet: 82 → 9
faces; filleted hole mouth: 8 faces; the joystick claws lost 39 and 24
faces). The band chains are found after region growing and the torus is
seeded from the bands' own axes (every band axis is a tangent of the blend's
centre circle), so parts without such chains are untouched. The Boundary
Fill script emits one `createTorus` tool per blend.

v0.3.1 (profile-fit fidelity): the prismatic profile fitter no longer lets
one circle absorb an exactly straight wall next to a gentle arc (a flat
mesh face used to come out as an r = 50–200 mm cylinder, a different one
per slab), walls and arcs are unified across slabs (no more micron-wide
seam faces on flat faces), and a perpendicular face under 0.25 mm from its
neighbour is a level of its own when it is not edge-connected to it (a
0.15 mm ledge used to be merged away). servo_bracket_1 went 60 → 23 faces
with the same deviation.

Synthetic CAD parts (see `tests/test_matrix.py`, `tests/test_facegroups.py`):
plates with holes/fillets, obround slots, hex pockets, stepped shafts, cross
and blind holes, hollow parts, drafted blocks, chamfers, countersinks, small
interior steps, tilted and rotated parts, tiny (3 mm) and huge (1.5 m) parts
convert to the exact face count with sub-0.1 mm deviation on the prismatic
route; a sphere boss (6 planes + 1 sphere), a top-edge-filleted box (6
planes + 4 cylinders), a plate with a spherical dimple, an icosphere (one
spherical face), a boss with a filleted base (7 planes + 1 cylinder + 1
torus) and a plate with a filleted hole mouth (6 + 1 + 1 torus) come out
exact through the face-group engine.

## Limitations (v0.3)

* The **CadQuery / Fusion sketch script** only exists for prismatic results
  (the extrusion engine is the only route that yields sketch + extrude
  structure); face-group results get the Boundary Fill script instead, which
  works only on cleanly fitted parts (see Usage).
* The face-group engine fits **planes, cylinders, cones (apex cones and
  tapered pins included), spheres and tori** (constant-radius rolling-ball
  blends around curved edges); variable-radius corner fillets and free-form
  blends keep their exact facets or stay as short cylinder bands, and a
  torus is only found where the blend spans at least three such bands
  (about 10° of the ring). A gently curved taper is approximated by a few
  cones, as many as the fit tolerance needs. It targets CAD exports
  (coplanar facet pairs); scans stay on the faceted route. Face edges are
  the projected mesh polylines (chords), not surface–surface intersection
  curves yet.
* Scan input defaults to faceted (`--force-prismatic` overrides); the scan
  repair ladder needs pymeshlab (Linux x86_64).
* The CadQuery script reproduces the recognised extrusion structure; patched
  regions are not in the script.

## Roadmap

In rough priority order:

- **Curved-plate consolidation for Boundary Fill.** A body whose gently
  curved plates segment into many near-parallel plane strips (the frame)
  never closes its cells: the strips' tools cannot reach each other at
  grazing angles. Needs curved fits over gently-bent plane chains, tools
  first. (Torus fits landed in v0.3.2; apex cones and tapered pins in
  v0.3.3; pinch repair, blend-chain tools and the OCC dry-run outlook in
  v0.3.4 — variable-radius fillets stay exact bands in the STEP by design.)
- **Clean intersection edges on face-group solids.** Today each analytic face
  in the STEP is bounded by the mesh's own polyline edges. Done via the
  Fusion 360 Boundary Fill script for cleanly fitted parts (experimental,
  see Usage); still to do natively in the STEP.
- **Named features in the generated script** — `hole()`, counterbores and
  `fillet()` calls instead of raw cylinder cuts.
- **Region growing for 3D scans** — real faces on scanned parts instead of a
  faceted solid.
- **Faster conversions** — warm worker process, bodies converted in parallel.
- **X-Ray as a job.** A 500-slice stack of a big organic scan does not fit
  the 240 s download budget; running it as a job (like a conversion, with
  progress and cancel) or streaming the script section by section would
  lift the limit. A "Loft the stack" option in the X-Ray script is the
  other half (the add-in has it).
