"""Plane sections of a triangle mesh, and clean sketch curves fitted to them.

This is the engine behind "Create Mesh Section Sketch" + "Fit Curves to
Mesh Section" done by hand in Fusion: cut the mesh with a plane, chain the
crossing segments into closed loops, then redraw every loop as lines and
arcs where they hold the tolerance and as a fitted spline where they do
not (the domes of a controller shell, a scanned handle).

numpy only, on purpose: the same file is copied into the Fusion add-in,
which has no shapely or trimesh. The pipeline's sliced-loft mode uses the
plane cut too (`stl_to_solid.sliced_loft`), so every slice of a loft and every
sketch in the generated Fusion script comes from this one cutter.

Coordinates: `section_loops` returns 2-D points in an in-plane frame (u, v)
with `to_3d(xy)` = origin + u*x + v*y. Outer loops are counter-clockwise,
holes clockwise, holes attached to the outer loop that contains them.

A leaky mesh (separate surface patches, a scan) cuts into open chains as
well as closed loops. `section_curves` keeps them apart: closed loops are
nested and fitted as loops, open chains are fitted as open curves and drawn
open, exactly as Fusion's Create Mesh Section Sketch draws them, and free
ends closer than `join_mm` are joined first so an outline that is only
broken by hairline cracks between patches comes back closed. `section_loops`
(the loft's cutter) keeps its older behaviour of closing every chain by its
chord.
